# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science - Harvard
Repository created in order to share my journey through the introductory computer science course, a course directly from Rarvard University that is made available here in Brazil thanks to an initiative by Fundação Estudar for Brazilian students interested in understanding the fundamentals of computing . It is worth noting that the exercises completed here by me are available for example and in an attempt to cooperate with understanding and learning for other people. My advice is to take advantage of the available content as an aid to a better understanding of the course exercises.
